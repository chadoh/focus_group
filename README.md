Focus Group
===========

I was at a meeting in which I and all the other
participants were asked to fill out a series
of sticky notes for each empty cell in the following grid:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <th>Qualifications</th>
    <th>Development Experience</th>
    <th>Competencies</th>
    <th>Success Factors</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>1 (Associate)</th>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>1 (Associate)</th>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>2</th>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>3</th>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>4 (Senior)</th>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>5 (Principal)</th>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>6 (Senior Principal)</th>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Since I hate writing with a pen, I started developing
this rails app to try to replicate this
everyone-fills-out-sticky-notes-and-hands-them-to-a-secretary
functionality. My goal was to have the basic functionality
in place by the end of the meeting.

So, since it took me about an hour to throw this together,
there are no tests, no seed data, and no styles. And
though you can log in, I never finished hooking
it up so that your responses are associated with your
account.

But I'd like to think it was a valiant effort.
